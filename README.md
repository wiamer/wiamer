JavaScript Task 3
Task:

Write a function that takes one parameter (a whole number/integer) and checks if numbers from 1 to the given parameter (inclusive) are divisible by 2,3,5 while replacing with the appropriate words as specified below.

* Numbers divisible by 2 are replaced by "yu"

* Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced by "gi"

* Numbers divisible by 5 are replaced by "oh"

* Numbers are unchanged if not divsible by any of the above

 

If a number is divisible by more than one of the above, replace and join the words representing their divsiors, separating by hyphen (-).

NB: "divisible" in this case means no remainder after division.

 

Return an array containing all numbers from 1 to the passed argument(inclusive) where all divisible numbers have been replaced as specified above.

 

Call the function and pass 100 as an argument.

Call the function and pass it a random number of your choice

 

Examples:

4 is only divisible by 2. It would be replaced by "yu"

6 is divisible by 2 and 3. It would be replaced by "yu-gi"

30 is divisible by 2,3,and 5, so it would be replaced by "yu-gi-oh"

49 is not divisible by 2,3 or 5

 

Example output:

Assuming the function is called with 10 as argument, the output array would be of the form:

[1,"yu","gi",4,"oh","yu-gi",7,"yu","gi","yu-oh"]
